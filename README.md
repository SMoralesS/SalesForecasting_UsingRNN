# SalesForecasting_UsingRNN
Sales forecasting using deep learning (RNN with LSTM layers)

The problem is specified in: https://www.kaggle.com/c/competitive-data-science-predict-future-sales/data
There you can find the file sales_train_v2.csv (too big to upload it here)

The notebook Data_matrix.ipynb is only for rewrite the training data in a tensor form, where one index represent the store, 
other the product and the other the month.

In the RNN_Forecasting.ipynb notebook is the explanation and the training of the neural network
